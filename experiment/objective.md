1. To demonstrate the practical implementation of ALU using the Verilog hardware description language.

2. To enable learners to simulate and analyze the behavior of ALU using software tools.

3. To foster a deeper understanding of how ALU can be used to build more complex circuits and how to code in Verilog.

4. The objective of this experiment is to understand the working of an ALU.
